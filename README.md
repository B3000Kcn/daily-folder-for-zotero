A Zotero addon that provides a simple calendar interface to quickly create and navigate to daily collections. This addon is designed to help organize notes, clippings, and literature on a day-by-day basis.

## Features

- **Toolbar Button**: Adds a calendar icon to the Zotero main toolbar for quick access.
- **Calendar Popup**: A clean and simple calendar to visualize your daily collections.
    - Navigate through months using the arrow buttons.
    - Click the title (e.g., "2025-09") to switch to a year selector view.
- **Hierarchical Collections**: Automatically creates and manages collections in a `Root Folder / YYYY / YYYY-MM / YYYY-MM-DD` structure.
- **Quick Navigation**:
    - Click an existing date on the calendar (highlighted) to instantly navigate to that day's collection.
    - Click the "Today's Folder" button to create (if needed) and navigate to the collection for the current day.
- **Configurable**: The name of the root folder ("Daily Folder" by default) can be changed in the Zotero preferences.
